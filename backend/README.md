### Steps to run the app

## Before doing any of these steps, please make sure you have created your own cloud PostgreSQL database and have put the database details in the .env file. The example of the .env file can be found in .env.example.

1. Run the `yarn install` command to install all the package dependencies.
2. Run the `yarn seed` command to seed the database (assuming that you've created your own PostgreSQL database, and have put all the details in your .env file).
3. Run the `yarn start` command to start the program.
4. Your application will be accessible on http://localhost:3000 if ran locally.
